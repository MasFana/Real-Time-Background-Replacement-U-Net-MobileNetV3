Known bug : 
On insecure contexts Chrome/Chromium artificially caps every camera stream at 640 × 480 (and often falls back to 360 p) for privacy/security reasons.
That is exactly what you are seeing: the same machine, the same camera, but the page is opened on http://localhost:8501 → Chrome downgrades the stream → your code receives 360/480 frames and prints that size on the overlay.
